# fakenews-detection

__Work in progress: I'm compiling a list of python libraries one needs to install. For now, you can run the script, and use pip install to install missing packages (which there are a few..) Thanks for your patience!__

Example usage (the higher the score, the more similar the domain is to known fake news domains)

- get fakeness score for a mainstream domain 
`python sample_predict_domain_score.py  --domain wsj.com`

- get fakeness score for a low quality domain 
`python sample_predict_domain_score.py  --domain trumptrainnews.com`
